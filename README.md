# Ola-Case-Study

(Ensemble Learning - Bagging, Boosting, KNN Imputation)

Driver retention remains a significant challenge for Ola, with high attrition rates posing a continuous threat to operational stability. Drivers often switch to competitors like Uber due to competitive rates, contributing to the high churn rate. Replacing drivers is costly, negatively impacts operational efficiency, and reduces overall team morale.

To mitigate this, Ola's Analytics Department is developing a predictive model to identify drivers at risk of leaving the company. By analyzing various factors, including demographic information, employment tenure, and historical performance metrics, the model will provide actionable insights to proactively retain valuable drivers.

You are tasked with building this predictive model using key machine learning concepts like:
- Ensemble Learning - Bagging
- Ensemble Learning - Boosting
- KNN Imputation for Missing Values
- Handling Imbalanced Datasets

The objective is to predict driver attrition accurately and provide strategic recommendations for retention efforts, ensuring Ola maintains a stable and satisfied driver workforce.
